Expose git variables (HEAD description, branch name, short commit hash, message, git tags, and if the local repo has changed files) to your serverless services.
Moreover, it adds GIT related environment variables and tags (GIT_COMMIT_SHORT, GIT_COMMIT_LONG, GIT_BRANCH, GIT_IS_DIRTY, GIT_REPOSITORY, GIT_TAGS_OR_COMMIT) for each defined function in the serverless file. You can disable this by adding the following custom variable in your serverless.yml file:

```
custom:
  exportGitVariables: false
```

# Usage
```yaml

custom:
  gitDescription: ${git:repository} - ${git:branch} - ${git:tagsOrCommit}

functions:
  processEventBatch:
    name: ${self:provider.stage}-${self:service}-process-event-batch
    description: ${self:custom.gitDescription}

  processEventBatch2:
    name: ${self:provider.stage}-${self:service}-process-event-batch-2
    description: ${self:custom.gitDescription}

plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-git-variables

resources:
  Description: >
    ${self:service} ${git:branch}:${git:sha1}
    https://github.com/jacob-meacham/serverless-plugin-git-variables
    ${git:message}
```

## describe and describeLight
The describe (`${git:describe}`) and the describeLight (`${git:describeLight}`) variables are both used to return the most recent tag of the repo. However the difference is that whilst `describe` evaluates to `git describe --always`, the `describeLight` variable evaluates to `git describe --always --tags`.
`--always` will ensure that if no tags are present, the commit hash is shown as a fallback option. (See [git describe documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe) for more information).

Annotated tags are shown by both `describe` and `describeLight`, only `describeLight` will show lightweight tags (such as those generated when using GitHub's releases feature).

For more information on annotated and lightweight tags go to the [git documentation on tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).

## tagsOrCommit

The tagsOrCommit (`${git:tagsOrCommit}`) is used to get info about which git tags (separated by comma) are pointing to current commit and if none it will show commit ID as fallback.
